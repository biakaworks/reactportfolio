                My name is Biaka Zaidarhzauva and I have been a graphic design for over 11 years. I am experienced in many areas of design and marketing. Born in Aizawl, India, and growing up in Taiwan where my passion for drawing grew into a love for design, visual communications, and marketing. Over the years while working with many talented developers on websites, software and day-to-day conversations, I found myself more and more drawn to the world of developement.

                I'm very thankful for the opportunity to dive into fullstack development at KU's bootcamp. I look forward to utilizng my graphic design skills into fulstack developement in the future.
